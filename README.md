This repository aims to provide a helpful collection of tools to reduce the performance overhead often associated with modern website development.

## CEWT
_Custom Elements With (type-guarded) Templates_

A tool which generates TypeScript classes from HTML snippets, intended to make [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) easier to use by generating typed boilerplate. (Though if your intellisense can infer the types of returned querystrings given a static HTML string, this may not be that useful to you.)

## composite
_Composite materials for HTTP Towers_

A collection of helper functions and structs for use with the hyper/tower ecosystems.
